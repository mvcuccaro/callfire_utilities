php wrapper for the callfire 1.1 api subscription functions by Michael Cuccaro

I was doing some work with the callfire api and the version 2.0 api didnt have functions for the webhooks (subscriptions).
I didnt write a full wrapper for the 1.1 since I already did that for 2.0 but this is a small wrapper that encapsulates their curl calls
and will handle those 1.1 subscriptions.  There wasnt much documentation  - just a test form. My trial and error is hopefully someone 
elses gain. The get calls are pretty self explanitory but I put a use example of the add function. enjoy!
